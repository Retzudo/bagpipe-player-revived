This repo has to be as ancient as history. It sucks and it never went anywhere but it should because FOSS bagpipe
software needs to be a thing. So, if you're reading this, you are a programmer and you are also a wielder of the mighty Great Highland Bagpipe,
get in touch with me (or if you are just interested in this thing).
